## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Old Portfolio 2020**

    Used to create this site:

    - contentful as HeadlessCMS data management.
    - GatsbyJS as Web Server and site builder.
    - ReactJS as main coding library.
    - Yarn as package manager.
    - EmailJs so serve masked emails from site.
    - i18n - react-i18next as translator
    - react-helmet SEO tool
    - react-h5-audio-player to play some of my music.
  
This project was one of my first projects when taking seriously about Web Development It is a mixed profile.

Currently this repository is being hosted in [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/saturnoman/portfolio) and deployed using [Netlify](https://frosty-poincare-a18064.netlify.app/).
I have cloned into github just for centralized my work!
